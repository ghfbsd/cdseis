COMM This is a sample log file that scans for data listed in log files for
COMM all of the data distributed on CDs.  It illustrates how make up a cdseis
COMM input file, indicating where the data volume locations are (CDIR),
COMM the phase arrival time files are (PDIR) and where the log files are (LDIR).
COMM The request is a search for SKS between 145 degrees and 180 degrees for
COMM all earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.9, and requests data for four
COMM stations (ANMO, SSB, WOL2, WOL3) in a time window of two minutes before
COMM SKS and two minutes after SKS.
